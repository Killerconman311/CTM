UNITY 2_GIMM360:

My game have had the neccessary Unity assignments implemented for quite some time, but I havent been able to get my gitignore to keep the files required to run things like my gesture recognition. I think this time around everything is up to snuff

Since my game takes place in the clouds, there is a lack of areas where a reverb zone would make sense. That being said, I have created gazebo-like structures that spawn enemies when a new wave begins, and since they are covered, I made those 
my reverb zones. The Max distance is very short, since the covered area isnt large, but it makes the enemy spawning action sound super cool if you are close enough.
