All the fun stuff about my cool sick vr game


GIMM 360 notes:

The Audio file in the assets folder contains the sounds made and implemented for *UNITY 1* Assignment.
-"Assets/Audio/GOOFY_AHH_ELECTRICITY(1).wav" is spatially blended and loops until the prefab is destroyed.
the player holds and throws the lightning bolt, so as the bolt travels away, the sound moving further away
adds a layer of immersion. 
-"Assets/Audio/step5-voices.wav" triggers on enemies when the player steps within the range of each enemy's 
attack. 
-"Assets/Audio/Step6-tension.wav" Will play almost so quietly in the background that you don't notice is, but 
loud enough to subtly create a sense of urgency within the player.
